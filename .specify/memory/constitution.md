## Core Principles

> **Priority: Speed of Development**  
> These principles prioritize rapid iteration and getting a working solution quickly.

### I. Library-First
Use established libraries instead of writing custom solutions. Leverage well-tested, community-maintained packages to accelerate development and reduce bugs.

### II. Minimal Error Handling
Minimal error handling is acceptable for now. Focus on core functionality rather than exhaustive edge case coverage. Error handling can be enhanced in future iterations.

### III. Happy Path Focus
Focus on "Happy Path" functionality first. Implement the primary use cases and expected workflows before handling edge cases or failure scenarios.

### IV. Simple Structure
Code structure can be flat and simple. Avoid premature abstraction or over-engineering. Prefer straightforward, readable code over complex architectural patterns.

### V. No Unit Tests
No need for unit tests at this stage. Prioritize functional implementation over test coverage. Testing can be added as the codebase matures.

## Governance

These principles are designed for rapid prototyping and early-stage development. As the project matures, these guidelines should be revisited and updated to include:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full test coverage
- Robust architecture
